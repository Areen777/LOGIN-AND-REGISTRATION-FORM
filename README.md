This project demonstrates how to build a **simple but functional Login and Registration system** using Java, MySQL, and IntelliJ IDEA. It covers the complete flow: user registration, secure login authentication, and database connectivity.
‚ú® Features:
* User-friendly GUI forms for login and registration (built with Java Swing)
* MySQL database integration to store and retrieve user credentials
* Basic input validation to prevent empty or invalid entries
* Organized, modular Java code for easier understanding and maintenance
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
* Java(JDK)
* MySQL(for data storage)
* IntelliJ IDEA(IDE)
* JDBC(Java Database Connectivity)
üì¶ Project Structure:
* `src/` ‚Äì Contains Java source files:
* `LoginForm.java`
* `RegistrationForm.java`
* `DatabaseConnection.java`
* `db/` ‚Äì SQL script to create the users table
‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Set up your MySQL database and run the provided SQL script to create the required table.
4. Update the database connection details in `DatabaseConnection.java`.
5. Run `RegistrationForm` to create a new user, then log in via `LoginForm`.
‚úÖ Outcome:
By following this project, you will learn how to:
* Design Swing forms in Java
